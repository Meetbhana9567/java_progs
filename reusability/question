Which one is better???

It seems that the first one is better i.e. example of "direct"

But no... When using the "direct" you need to copy it's class
everytime to the present working directory... But with the package
proper placement of the file then... it will work for all multiple
projects and program with anydirectory with simple import...

---- and this is how we can use the concept of "reusability" ----
